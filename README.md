# movie-review-site

Movie review site using the TMDB API for grabbing data. Personal project to increase my React/JS knowledge.

I am familiar with tailwind/react/redux/typescript, but only for adding/editing existing screens, rather than starting from scratch.
Thought it was worth giving myself a playground to learn in.

As of current, the screen ideas are

Home page: Multiple different slider/carousel style inputs to show off the different movies, which are each clickable to take you to a details page.

Discover Page: using the top navigation bar you can search by genre, rating or name, this will then be part of the query sent over to the TMDB API, gathering relevant results
Long term plan is to add some system to save query data so navigating between pages will keep the query state. How i do this, redux/react router/url params, im not sure yet.

Details page: This will hold the details for a specific movie. Im not sure how far the TMDB API will go, i expect I cannot load user data onto my own site, but it would be interesting to create my own
user system, that then would allow me to create a watchlist system to add/remove on a user/user basis. In terms of backend stack, im not sure what I would use yet.

About Page: More about me, the different projects I am doing, and just testing different react/redux/ts/other ideas.

I think I will park this project at the home page for now, as it is taking hours to sort out CSS before getting onto the functionality I intended to try out/use.

Next plan is to try using docker / kubernetes, it would be interesting to try building a full stack app which could incorporate this. (Likely not this project)
